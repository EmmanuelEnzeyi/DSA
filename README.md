# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Overview

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the core of efficient programming. Mastery of DSA is essential for solving complex problems, optimizing code, and performing well in technical interviews. Here’s a structured path to understanding DSA and the key topics to study.

## What is DSA?

- **Data Structures**: Organized formats to store and manage data efficiently. They define how data is stored, accessed, and modified.
- **Algorithms**: Step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving specific problems. Algorithms manipulate data structures to solve complex problems and optimize resource usage.

Together, DSA helps in solving computational problems effectively, ensuring optimal use of memory and processing power.

## Key Topics in DSA

To become proficient in DSA, it’s helpful to break down the subject into several core areas:

### 1. Big O Notation
   - **Concept**: Analyzes the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity.
   - **Topics to Learn**:
     - Time Complexity
     - Space Complexity
     - Common Big O Notations (O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n²), etc.)

### 2. Data Structures

Data structures are the foundation for organizing and manipulating data. Here are the main ones:

#### **Basic Data Structures**
   - **Arrays**: Fixed-size structures for storing data of the same type.
   - **Linked Lists**: Elements linked using pointers; types include singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
   - **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure, with operations like push, pop, and peek.
   - **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) structure, with enqueue and dequeue operations.

#### **Advanced Data Structures**
   - **Hash Tables**: Structure that maps keys to values, enabling fast access to data.
   - **Trees**: Hierarchical structures with nodes; types include:
     - Binary Trees
     - Binary Search Trees (BST)
     - AVL Trees (self-balancing)
     - Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
   - **Graphs**: Set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges; used for network-like structures.
   - **Tries**: Special tree for efficient string searching.

### 3. Algorithms

Algorithms are the procedures that operate on data structures to solve problems. Here are the main categories:

#### **Searching Algorithms**
   - **Linear Search**: Sequentially checks each element; O(n) complexity.
   - **Binary Search**: Efficient search for sorted arrays; O(log n) complexity.
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for graph traversal.

#### **Sorting Algorithms**
   - **Selection Sort**: Simple but slow; repeatedly finds the minimum element.
   - **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements; O(n²) complexity.
   - **Insertion Sort**: Builds a sorted array by inserting elements one at a time.
   - **Merge Sort**: Divide-and-conquer approach; O(n log n) complexity.
   - **Quick Sort**: Partition-based divide-and-conquer; average O(n log n) complexity.

#### **Recursion**
   - **Concept**: Functions that call themselves to solve sub-problems.
   - **Common Examples**:
     - Factorial calculation
     - Fibonacci sequence
   - **Backtracking**: Special recursive technique used in algorithms like N-Queens and solving mazes.

#### **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
   - **Concept**: Optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to sub-problems.
   - **Examples**:
     - Fibonacci sequence (DP approach)
     - Longest Common Subsequence
     - Knapsack problem

#### **Greedy Algorithms**
   - **Concept**: Makes locally optimal choices at each step.
   - **Examples**:
     - Coin Change Problem
     - Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for minimum spanning trees

#### **Divide and Conquer**
   - **Concept**: Splits problems into sub-problems, solves them independently, and combines results.
   - **Examples**:
     - Merge Sort
     - Quick Sort
     - Binary Search

### 4. Graph Algorithms
   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: For exploring nodes and edges.
   - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths from a source node.
   - **A* Search**: Heuristic-based shortest path algorithm.
   - **Kruskal’s and Prim’s Algorithms**: Used for finding minimum spanning trees.
