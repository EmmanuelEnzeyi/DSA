# Understanding O(n³) - Cubic Time Complexity

Cubic time complexity, denoted as O(n³), describes an algorithm whose execution time grows proportionally to the cube of the input size. This complexity is commonly observed in algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set.

## When to Expect O(n³) Complexity

You will typically encounter O(n³) time complexity in scenarios involving three nested loops that each iterate through a data structure. Here are some common scenarios:

- **3D Matrix Manipulations**: When processing or iterating through elements in a three-dimensional array.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Certain algorithms that examine every triplet of nodes in a graph may exhibit cubic complexity.
- **Brute Force Solutions**: Problems where all possible combinations of three elements from a list must be checked.

## Mathematical Representation

The mathematical representation of cubic complexity can be expressed as:

\[ T(n) = c \cdot n^3 + d \]

where:
- \( T(n) \) is the time taken by the algorithm,
- \( c \) is a constant that depends on the algorithm's implementation,
- \( d \) represents additional overhead.

As \( n \) grows larger, the \( n^3 \) term becomes the dominant factor, making it a key component in analyzing performance.

## Example Algorithm

Here's a simple example of an O(n³) algorithm in Python that finds all triplets in an array that sum up to a specific target:

```python
def find_triplets(arr, target):
    n = len(arr)
    triplets = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == target:
                    triplets.append((arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]))
    return triplets

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 9
print(find_triplets(arr, target))  # Output: [(1, 3, 5), (2, 3, 4)]
